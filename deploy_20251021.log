Pending kernel upgrade
----------------------

Newer kernel available

The currently running kernel version is 6.14.0-1011-aws which is not the 
expected kernel version 6.14.0-1014-aws.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, 
so you should consider rebooting.

debconf: (Dialog frontend will not work on a dumb terminal, an emacs shell buffer, or without a controlling terminal.)
debconf: falling back to frontend: Readline
debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Readline
debconf: (This frontend requires a controlling tty.)
debconf: falling back to frontend: Teletype

Restarting services...

Service restarts being deferred:
 /etc/needrestart/restart.d/dbus.service
 systemctl restart getty@tty1.service
 systemctl restart networkd-dispatcher.service
 systemctl restart serial-getty@ttyS0.service
 systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
 systemctl restart unattended-upgrades.service

No containers need to be restarted.

No user sessions are running outdated binaries.

No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries on this host.
Synchronizing state of nginx.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable nginx
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
